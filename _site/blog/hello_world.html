          <h1>Hello brave new world</h1>

<p>After months of rumination, I have finally converged to a good personal website solution.
As it turned out, the toughest part was to choose the right frameworks!
At first, I was reluctant to use the popular <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (I&#39;m not a Ruby programmer) in favor of the Python-based <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.
However, Jekyll and its surrounding ecosystem is more mature and I have not run into limitations like I did with my initial attempt using Pelican.</p>

<p>Some highlights of this website are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Static site generation.
This allows me to edit plain text files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown syntax</a> and having them transformed to static HTML that doesn&#39;t require fancy server-side logic.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive design</a> using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
Bootstrap also provides a useful library of sane building blocks that allow a HTML/JavaScript illiterate like me to produce cross-platform websites.</li>
<li>Good separation between layout and content.</li>
<li>Easy integration with BibTeX using <a href="http://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll-Scholar</a>.</li>
<li>I can deploy changes and new content to the website with a simple <code>make deploy</code> command.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source of my website is <a href="http://github.com/andersbll/website">on Github</a> - feel free to grab whatever you might find useful. Also, you should consider adding plenty of <a href="http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/">HTML9</a> pizzazz!</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-this-blog">Purpose of this blog</h2>

<p>I have included a blog on my website as an attempt to exercise my communication skills.
While academia is still focused on the traditional publication pipeline through peer-review, there are plenty of good web-based publication alternatives nowadays.
A blog is a practical way to publish work and findings in an informal manner.
Another motivation behind this blog is the chance to dump the academic by-products that would never get published otherwise (e.g. presentations, notes, tutorials, mediocre results).
I suspect these by-products can be put online without too much work - and they might even be useful for others.</p>

<p>So far, this is all cheap talk on my part as I have yet to fill up this website!
My intentions are to write on a monthly basis (a lower bound).
At least, now that I have a website, I have one less excuse for keeping my work to myself.</p>
